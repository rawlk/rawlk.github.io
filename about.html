## About

Rawlk Technologies is a collection of people and projects. A majority of these projects are self hosted sites, semi-sketchy cs projects <small><i>(like a budget password cracking cluster)</i></small>, and physical hack-and-slash solutions to every day problems. There might be a few useful tidbits hidden deep within some of these projects and posts, but as always, stay outa trouble <font color='black'> ...or dont get caught ;) </font>
