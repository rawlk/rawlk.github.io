Just before the trip I replaced the shackles on the back with the stock shackles (raising it up a couple inches) in hopes of putting the heavier leafs back on. Turns out, the leafs already on it are stronger than the loose ones I have . Ahwell... Well now it rides a couple inches higher in the back if ever I actually get to do some trails.

Along with the shackles, I got everything greased up that I could (though i still have a heavy steering/front end squeak I cant seem to fix).

Anyways, I took ~4 days to get to the new apartment fully loaded with most of my belongings tucked away in the back. I stopped at a couple camp grounds and camped out in a tent each night. It was a lot easier than I had thought to find campsites and get in and out. Wasn't in any sort of rush, but I loved being able to check in to a place lateish at night, pop up a tent and be able to leave relatively early without really having to talk to anyone :-P First two nights it rained and stormed which was quite relaxing and kept the temps way down during the day drives.

From Oklahoma to the San Francisco Bay area in 4ish days (I say ish because two days were super short). Heres a link to a few photos and Later I might post some other data thats kinda neat.

Ended up getting (pretty consistently) just a hair over 20MPG the whole trip, quite a bit better than I was honestly expecting. Truck did excellent, new windshield has no new chips.. OH, I do need to post about that AC leak though...
