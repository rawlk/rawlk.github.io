Take 2! Finally managed to get out again. Just one other and myself this time. Had to try out the new camera! As with just about all of these outings, any of the 'nice' photos are coming from his camera and all of the lacklustre photos/videos are from me :)

This time, we made it out to, as the title says, [Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=546). There was an absolute TON of green and even more water than last time at [Uvas Canyon.](/adventure/2016/01/18/Uvas-Canyon-County-Park.html). When I do these little 'Google Photos' videos, they're really cool, but they really don't do the place justice. If you ever get to the area, I'd highly suggest visiting just about any of the places here in [Adventure](/tags/adventure.html)
